# Disentanglement papers at NEURIPS 2019
TL;DR - On disentangling the menagerie of disentanglement papers 

## Backdrop
During this NEURIPS(2019), I encountered a glut of papers (a dozen in the main conf and more if you throw in the workshops) where the authors were all working off of different notions of disentanglement.
This is an effort to make sense of it all.
